If you don't have a unit test runner in your IDE you can run tests via the command line by running the following command from the scripts directory

```
PS C:\..\pair-programming-workshop\csharp\scripts> .\runtests.bat 

```

## Elixir Project

The project is contained within the `elixir` folder, and assumes that you have Elixir installed already. This project makes use of ExUnit, a built-in unit testing library for Elixir. Run the `mix test` command in the `elixir` directory to run the unit tests:

``` elixir
mix test
```
